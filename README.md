# Smart Traffic Analyzer and Signal Controller

An AI-based smart traffic signal control system that analyzes traffic density using computer vision and dynamically adjusts signal timings for a single junction.

##  Project Overview
This project uses a pre-trained YOLOv8 object detection model to detect and count vehicles from prerecorded lane-wise traffic videos. Based on real-time vehicle density, the system allocates adaptive green signal durations to improve traffic flow efficiency.

##  Objectives
- Detect and count vehicles from each lane using AI
- Classify traffic density (Low / Medium / High)
- Dynamically adjust traffic signal timings
- Simulate intelligent traffic control without physical hardware

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- NumPy
